# Open Parliament

Open Parliament is a digital democracy project with the goal of making
the legislative power more transparent, allowing the common citizen to
follow what is voted and who voted what with minimum effort. We also
want to give them the proper tools, so that they can exercise the
legislative activity themselves, voting on the same bills as the
official legislators and proposing their own.

The initial concept was exposed in this article:
